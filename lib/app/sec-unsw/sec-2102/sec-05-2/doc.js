      The IS Curve is one of 2 curves in the ${doc.b`IS-LM Model`}.
      The I stands for investment and the S standds for savings. It
      exists to model interest rates, which has important implications
      for all sorts of facets of society. What an increase in the real
      interest rate means, the cost of borrowing captial for businesses
      and households goes up. Consumers respond borrow less for new
      housing, firms respond by reducing their purchases of machines
