      Consistency in this context can be described a number of ways,

      ${doc.b`ùõΩ‚±º`} as the size of the sample to esimate ${doc.b`ùõΩ‚±º`}
      increases. As the sample size increasese the inifinity

        When the unconditional mean assumption mean fails, it

        Put another way ${doc.b`if the error is correlated with
        any of the independent variables, then OLS is biased and
        inconsistent`}. This can be written more formually as:

      But in order demostrate this point we use an example
      of an omitted variable to demostrate this. For
      practical purposes here we can treat inconsistency as
      the same as the bias, the main difference largely being
      that an inconsistency is generally expressed in terms
      of the population variance of ${doc.b`x‚ÇÅ`} and the
      covariance between ${doc.b`x‚ÇÅ`} and ${doc.b`x‚ÇÇ`}.

      If the 2 variables aren't correlated then ùõø‚ÇÅ is 0 and

      kind of bias (positive or negative) for a given
      correlation (positive or negative) there will be a
      like inconsistency (posititve or negative). But an
      important point about inconsistency in OLS estimators
      is it doesn't go away by adding more observations to the

        It would be more accurate to say the greater degree of freedom the
        better (not necessarily the number observations), as models with
