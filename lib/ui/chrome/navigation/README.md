# URL Routing

- Apps identified by organized hierarchical IDs:
  - Complex Analysis: `c.1.1`, `c.2.1`, etc.
  - ECON1101: `1101.1`, etc.
  - Debug: `d.1`, `d.2`, etc.
- URLs use `?app=c.1.1` format
- Navigation handles browser back/forward automatically
- IDs map to corresponding directories and files within `lib/app/`
